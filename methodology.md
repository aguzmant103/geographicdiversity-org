Our data methodology is designed to provide accurate and insightful analysis of client distribution and geographic information. We source our data from [Nodewatch.io](https://nodewatch.io/), a platform specializing in detailed network metrics. Hereâ€™s an overview of our approach:

## Data Collection
We gather data from Nodewatch.io, which offers comprehensive details about client types, countries, and geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).

## Data Processing
The raw data is processed through several steps to generate valuable insights:

#### Geographic Categorization:
Each entry in the dataset is categorized by continent based on its latitude and longitude. This classification helps us organize the data regionally for more targeted analysis.

#### Data Aggregation:
We aggregate the data to provide a summary of clients and their distribution across continents and countries. This involves calculating counts and percentages to reflect the prevalence of different clients and their geographical spread.

#### Summary and Output:
The processed data is compiled into a structured summary that includes total counts, percentage distributions, and detailed breakdowns by continent and country.

By following this methodology, we ensure that our data is collected, stored, and processed effectively to deliver accurate and actionable insights into client distribution and geographic patterns.
